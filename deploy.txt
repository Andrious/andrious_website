::@ECHO OFF

GOTO exit

flutter build web --release // To build in the build/web for production

flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html // to run the app

flutter build web --web-renderer html --release

auto (default) - automatically chooses which renderer to use. This option chooses the HTML renderer when the app is running in a mobile browser, and CanvasKit renderer when the app is running in a desktop browser.
--web-renderer html        is smaller
--web-renderer canvaskit   is faster

HTML renderer: when the app is running in a mobile browser.
CanvasKit renderer: when the app is running in a desktop browser.
