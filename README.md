> Andrious Solutions Ltd. extends our profound respect and immeasurable gratitude to all the ancestors and keepers of the land on whose traditional territories our work takes place. We acknowledge that we are on Treaty 1 territory, the traditional gathering place of the Anishinaabe, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota and Dene people and the traditional homeland of the MÃ©tis people. This land is sacred, historical, and significant.
> Every time we acknowledge this truth, we have an invitation and an opportunity to reflect on the wrongs of the past, what we do in the present, and what we can do to continually honour the people whose lands and water we benefit from today.
> This statement only acts as a first step in honouring the land we reside on and its peoples, and must be paired with education, understanding and informed action.
